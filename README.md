# slack-test

* This will be committed while the Slack channell is public.
* Changed on a forked branch
* Another change on forked branch, after previous PR merged.
* and another change before PR has been merged.
* One more before making the channel private.

## After making channel private:
* Nothing to say here.  Guess we'll find out what happens soon enough.

## No luck after making channel private
* Tried /github subscribe again in the channel, got 'no permission' error.
* Slack said use @GitHub to add GitHub to the conversation.
* Sent @GitHub 'testing' and was prompted to add GitHub to conversation.
* Tried /github subscribe again and it appears to have worked.  We'll see after this commit.
