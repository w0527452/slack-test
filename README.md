# slack-test

* This will be committed while the Slack channell is public.
* Changed on a forked branch
* Another change on forked branch, after previous PR merged.
* and another change before PR has been merged.
* One more before making the channel private.

## After making channel private:
* Nothing to say here.  Guess we'll find out what happens soon enough.
